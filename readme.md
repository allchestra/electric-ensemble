# Electric Ensemble

**Play a live ensemble using midi.**

As a player - play a midi instrument, and the notes will be distributed to performers, creating a real-world ensemble that can be played over midi. 

As a performer - join a real world session, and subscribe to play or sing the notes from the player. 

## Plan 

### Solo
* [x] Receiving midi input events
* [x] Render notes
* [ ] Interpret midi notes in the context of the current scale.

### With Electric Team
* [ ] Port to electric starter
* [ ] Show live notes in browser
* [ ] Split notes across different staves (single screen)
* [ ] Allow player to join the session and choose their range
* [ ] Split across machines


## Extension
Use pressure to send other messages e.g. volume, articulation.
